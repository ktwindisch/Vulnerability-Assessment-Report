<h1>Vulnerability Assessment Report</h1>

<h2>Scenario:</h2>
As a cybersecurity analyst, I am writing this report to assess the security of the remote database server that this particular organization uses to store customer information. I have identified several vulnerabilities with the current configuration of the server. These vulnerabilities could be exploited by malicious actors to gain access to sensitive customer data.</br>
</br>
Furthermore, the vulnerabilities that I have identified, pose a significant risk. If an attacker were to gain access to the database server, they could steal customer data, such as names, addresses, and credit card numbers. This data could then be used to commit fraud or identity theft.

In addition, the reputation of the organization could be damaged if news of a data breach were to become public. Customers may be hesitant to do business with a company that has been hacked.

<h2>Frameworks Used:</h2>

- <b>NIST SP 800-30 Rev.1</b><br/>

NIST SP 800-30 is a publication that provides guidance on performing risk assessments. It outlines
strategies for identifying, analyzing, and remediating risks. Organizations use NIST SP 800-30 to gain
insights into the potential likelihood and severity of risksâ€”helping them make informed decisions
about allocating resources, implementing controls, and prioritizing remediation efforts.

<h2>Environments Used:</h2>

- <b>Windows 10</b>
